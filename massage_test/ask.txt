I'm currently making a messenger bot and the problem I encounter is that even though my webhook setting checks out and the page's tests are successful (in v2.10), my server still receives no message.

This is what I tried:
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/subscribed_apps?access_token=PAGE_ACCESS_TOKENS"

My program returns a {"success":true} message but my server does not receive the verify message mentioned in this article: 
"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference#validation"

What it print out however is this: 

"{"error":{"message":"An unknown error occurred","type":"OAuthException","code":1,"error_subcode":1929003,"is_transient":false,"error_user_title":"Sample Unavailable","
error_user_msg":"The provided object and field combination does not have a sample implementation associated with it and cannot be tested.","fbtrace_id":"G9XWBeCkX4m"}}
"

Does anyone know the reason why?
